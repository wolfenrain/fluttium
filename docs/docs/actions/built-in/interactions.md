# ü§ù Interactions

Fluttium provides a set of actions that will allow you to interact with your application as the user.

## Tapping/clicking

To tap or click on parts of the application you can use the `pressOn` action. This action will find
the item you want to click on and emit a pointer event to Fluter. The full YAML syntax of this
action is as followed:

```yaml
- pressOn:
    text: 'Your Text' # An optional text regexp that is used to find a widget by semantic labels and visible text
    offset: [10, 150] # An optional offset to tap somewhere on the screen.
```

The short-hand syntax for this action will assume you are using the text search:

```yaml
- pressOn: 'Your Text'
```

## Long press

To emit a long press to the application you can use the `longPressOn` action. The full YAML syntax
of this action is as follows:

```yaml
- longPressOn:
    text: 'Your Text' # An optional text regexp that is used to find a widget by semantic labels and visible text
    offset: [10, 150] # An optional offset to tap somewhere on the screen.
```

The short-hand syntax for this action will assume you are using the text search:

```yaml
- longPressOn: 'Your Text'
```

## Scrolling and Swiping

To scroll in any direction or swipe horizontally you can use the `scroll` and `swipe` actions
respectively.

The `scroll` action YAML syntax is as followed:

```yaml
- scroll:
    in: 'Your List View' # The widget to scroll in, can be a regex pattern
    until: 'Your List Item' # The widget to scroll to, can be a regex pattern
    direction: up # Defaults to down, can be left, right or top as well
    timeout: 5000 # In milliseconds, default is 10 seconds
    speed: 10 # Defaults to 40
```

The `swipe` action YAML syntax is as followed:

```yaml
- swipe:
    in: 'Your List View' # The widget to scroll in, can be a regex pattern
    until: 'Your List Item' # The widget to scroll to, can be a regex pattern
    direction: right # Defaults to left, can only be left or right
    timeout: 5000 # In milliseconds, default is 10 seconds
    speed: 10 # Defaults to 40
```
